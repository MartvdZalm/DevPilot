# DevPilot
The **Local Development Dashboard** is a tool designed to simplify the process of managing local software projects that consist of multiple parts such as backends, frontends, and additional services.

## What does the dashboard do?
The Local Development Dashboard offers an interface where developers can:
- Manage their projects
- Organize and control associated modules (e.g. frontend apps, backend servers, scripts)
- Launch and monitor multiple components from a single place

A **project** represents a logical group of related modules, and a **module** is any individually executable part of the project.

## Purpose
The goal of this application is to increase developer productivity by making local development workflows more efficient and less error prone.

## Features (in short)
- Create and organize software projects
- Add executable modules to a project
- Launch modules from the dashboard
- Link apps (e.g. terminals, IDEs, services) to projects
- Open projects directly in terminals, file explorers, or editors
